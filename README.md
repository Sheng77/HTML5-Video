Bulletproof HTML5 Video
=======================

About
-----

This solution only requires two video formats, MP4 and WebM, with a Flash fallback using the .mp4 file for older browsers that don't support HTML5 video.

### WebM & MP4

WebM is the standards based video format designed to provide a royalty-free, high-quality open video compression format for use with HTML5 video and is supported in *Chrome*, *Firefox* and *Opera*. *IE9* (and up) and Safari only supports the more commonly known MP4 video as do both *iOS* and *Android* devices.

Support
-------
Browser/device support include Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, iOS, Android and the Blackberry Browser. The only dark area is in Opera Mini which does not support the Video element.
